# XSS Hunter Bluk Delete Chrome Extension

This is a Friendly chrome extension to bulk delete captured pages from xsshunter.com, Created as a side project to learn about Chrome Extensions. 

I had too many Pages in my XSS Hunter Account and It's just annoying when I can't Delete a lot of them together. so I decided to take a fun learning challenge and spent a day learning and create this little tinny Chrome Extension.

Any thing else that should be added? don't be lazy help me out! ;) 

## How to Use?

- Go to chrome://extensions
- Now, Enable developer mode. (If you hhavenâ€™t already.. WHY?)
- Click on Load Unpacked and select your folder of this Extension. 
- The extension will be installed now.
